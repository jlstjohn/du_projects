These projects were originally done for COMP4432: Machine Learning course as jupyter notebook files.

I am in the process of adapting each project into a different type of python application/project in order to continue exloring the data, building my skills, and to be honest...it's difficult not to tumble down the rabbit hole.

Notes:
- titanic_survival: Difference in scoring outputs between jupyter notebook file and python file is due to scaling data prior to all models in the python file. As noted in the py file, grid search was done on the SVM classifier to fine tune and obtain a ROC-AUC score even closer to the logistic regression model.
- Additionally, some minor mistakes were made in the original copy of the notebook that I have since corrected, mostly in the data clean-up steps.
